# IDTHackathon2019: Automated voice call summaries using Natural Language Processing

Things move fast in the world of business.  Many phone calls and meetings take place where important decisions are made between any number of people.  Traditionally, someone would have to take notes from the meeting discussion and send those notes out to all participants to confirm the decisions made.  Using voice to text technologies and by developing some AI to understand context of the discussion, can you automate this meeting summary process?



## Features:

1. Voice-Text Conversion
2. Multiple Speaker Detection
